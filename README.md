# Data-analysis-house-pricing-mongodb-aggregation
Data analysis project that explores house pricing data using MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline and Python (PyMongo). Implements stages like `$match`, `$group`, and `$sort` to derive insights such as combined bedroom–floor metrics and exports the final results as newline‑delimited JSON for further analysis or visualization.
